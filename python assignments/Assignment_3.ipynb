Therefore, reusability is a big advantage  \nFunctions helps to divide larger problems into smaller manageable modules  \nWe can use a function without knowing how the function is actually written. So functions help us to use them without knowing the complexity behind them. For the same reason, function can be shared and reused by other programmers and users  ",
